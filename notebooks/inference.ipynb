    "    You can use your own previuolsy trained model (if you have used PyTorch for that). Indeed, PyTorch stores model weights in a file with extension <i>pth.tar</i>. You can place this file into the <i>models</i> folder and try to follow the same structure that is described above. You also need to fill a <i>commandline.json</i> file with all the parameters used during the training (see <a href=\"https://clinicadl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Train/Introduction/#outputs\">ClinicaDL documentation</a>) for further info.</p>\n",

    "<b>Soft voting:</b><p>\n",
    "    For classification tasks that take as input a part of the MRI volume (<i>patch, roi or slice</i>), an ensemble operation is needed to obtain the label at the image level.</p>\n",
    "    <p>For example, size and stride of 50 voxels on linear preprocessing leads to the classification of 36 patches, but they are not all equally meaningful. Patches that are in the corners of the image are mainly composed of background and skull and may be misleading, whereas patches within the brain may be more useful.</p>\n",
